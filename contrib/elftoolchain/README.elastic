Elftoolchain@Elastic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Elftoolchain has been imported in elastic/ebpf to get rid of the GPLed libelf
  present on most linux systems.

  In order to make Elftoolchain fit the project and also work with a recent
  libbpf we had to make a few changes. This file documents those changes.


Changes to the build system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  o All Makefiles were removed.
  o Dependency on bmake(1) is removed in favor of GNUmake.
  o Only libelf/ and common/ are imported.
  o The sole Makefile now is libelf/GNUMakefile, running make there will generate
    libelf_pic.a. Other artifacts like shared objects were also removed.
  o Documentation, manpages, tools, tests also removed.


Changes to please libbpf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  o All the following changes are guarded under ifdef ELASTIC.
  o Define empty stubs for a bunch of gelf_* functions. They return NULL/zero,
    and since it's not used by elastic/ebpf, this is fine.
  o Declared missing types in gelf.h.
  o Renamed elf_{openmemory, open} to elftoolchain_{openmemory, open}, these
    names clash with an exported symbol from libbpf.
  o Created a missing elf.h in sys/.
