    GPL - eBPF programs which are GPL licensed

    build_demos.sh - build script for demo build

    build_lib.sh - build script for static library

    clean.sh - script cleaning all build output

---------------------------------------------------------
eBPF programs consist of:

    KprobeConnectHook - hooks into tcp_v4_connect and adds destination IP to allowlist if PID is allowed

    TcFilter - attaches to network interface and filters packets based on allowed IPs

Tools and loaders consist of:

    UpdateIPsDemo - Userspace tool for updating IP allowlist

    UpdatePidsDemo - Userspace tool for updating PID allowlist

    KprobeConnectHookDemo - Loader for KprobeConnectHook eBPF program

    TcLoaderDemo - Loader for TcFilter eBPF program, attaches to ens33 interface by default

Tests consist of:

    TcFilterTest - test suite the TcFilter.bpf.o program using BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN

---------------------------------------------------------
How to run Host Isolation demo:

    1. run `build_demos.sh`

    2. copy TcFilter.bpf.o to the same directory as TcLoaderDemo

    3. run `sudo ./TcLoaderDemo` - packet filter is now attached to ens33

    4. run `sudo ./KprobeConnectHookDemo` - connect hook is attached

    5. run `firefox` in another tab - verify that all internet access is blocked

    6. run `pgrep firefox` to get the PID of the browser

    7. run `sudo ./UpdatePidsDemo <firefox PID>`

    8. verify that firefox connects to any page

    9. quit KprobeConnectHook with Ctrl+C and run `sudo ./TcLoaderDemo unload` to detach both eBPF programs



## Run Tests

### TcFilterTest

```
sudo make -C GPL/HostIsolation/TcFilter test
```

Or if you want to use a custom path for the eBPF object file.

```
sudo ELASTIC_EBPF_TC_FILTER_OBJ_PATH=/tmp/TcFilter.bpf.o  make -C GPL/HostIsolation/TcFilter  test
```
